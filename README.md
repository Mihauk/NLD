# NLD
- Project on studying Celluar automata(Kinetically Constrained lattice gas) like simulations to study the behaviour of correlation functions at late time in the presence of non-linearity(Non Linear Diffusion).
- Here we have implemented the simulattion in 3 different languages python Julia and Rust in respective order in search for perrforrmance gains.
- Rust multi-threaded code seems to be the most stable and as fast as julia multi-threaded one.
- the fastest of all is Julia GPU code with multi-threading.
